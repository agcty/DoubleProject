\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This work would not have been possible without the support and feedback of my family, supervisor, friends and the academic staff of UCLAN.

I am especially indebted to	my supervisor Mr. Chris Casey, who has been very supportive and always actively provided me with feedback during the development of this project. I am also thankful of the time he took to thoroughly read various iterations of this dissertation. With his constant support I feel confident that the quality of my work has drastically improved. 

I would also like to show my gratitude towards Dr. Lee Guo for giving me the tools and techniques to critically think about Object Oriented Design. In addition, a thank you to Dr. Nick Mitchell, who introduced me to advanced concepts of  ultithreading, and whose passion for specifications and code contracts has forevery changed my view on software architecture.

I am grateful to all of those whom I have had the pleasure to work with during during my studies at UCLAN. I would also like to thank Markus MÃ¼llner, who has been a very long and good friend and is always open for constructive discussions about technology and life.

Nobody has been	more important to me in the	pursuit	of this	project	than the members of	my family who gave me the opportunity to study and live in the UK and supported me in any situation in life.
