\chapter{Abstract}

% The goals of the application are stated as:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Provide some interesting data about ISS with at least some being live (e.g. current position—possibly drawn on a map, and number of astronauts currently onboard ISS)
%     \item Ability for the user to add their observations of the ISS to a database—for each entry you need to include a timestamp, coordinates (latitude and longitude) and a note (as plain text), optionally allow the user to attach one or more pictures
%     \item Ability to view the list of ISS observations in the database (with a way of removing and editing entries),
%     \item Ability to view the pass times as a list of entries with the next 5 times the ISS is visible from the present location and the duration of each pass.
% \end{enumerate}
