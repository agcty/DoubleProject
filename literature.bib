@inproceedings{DynamicallyTypedLanguages:proceedings,
Abstract = {Dynamically typed languages have recently turned out to be suitable for developing specific scenarios where dynamic adaptability or rapid prototyping are important issues. However, statically typed programming languages commonly offer more opportunities for compiler optimizations and earlier type error detection. Due to the benefits of both approaches, some programming languages such as C{\#} 4.0, Boo, Visual Basic or Objective-C provide both static and dynamic typing. We describe the StaDyn programming language that supports both type systems in the very same programming language. The main contribution of StaDyn is that it keeps gathering type information at compile time even over dynamically typed references, obtaining a better runtime performance, earlier type error detection, and an intuitive combination of statically and dynamically typed code.},

abstract="Search engine optimization (SEO) pertains to the activity of optimizing individual websites and webpages to get higher page rank in the search results. Websites are ordinarily optimized through back links, while individual webpages are optimized through specific keywords. In this paper, we propose a framework based on set of guidelines for keyword research analysis and back links generation. The proposed framework suggests that webpage content should be based on keywords and the site traffic should be monitored through referrals. We argue that if a website has some prevalent and pertinent keywords in its content and title along with a reasonable amount of back links that help watch the website traffic, then we can get better rank for the website in the search results. The framework also emphasizes that proper keyword selection and link building should be taken into account when developers and designers work on a software development project. The results of the study are reported here.",
